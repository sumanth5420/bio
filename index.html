            <h3><b><center>Project-Autonomous Drone as First Responder for Search and Report Missions in any Seawater Environment</b></h3>
                <p>In this project we are going to find out the emergency persons in the sea water with the help of quadcopter using the hardwar e
                    components we build the drone using the hardware components and we have done the software of the project with the help of
                    datasets using python code in this project my role is to create the dataset for object detection using python language and it will
                    detect the object face and name.</center></p>

            <h3><b>5G Base Station Uplink Receiver Performance Analysis</b></h3>
            <p><center>In this project my role was to create a mat lab code of half of the code my part is to create the parameters, bandwidth, transmit
                antennas using PRB allocation with the help of matrix indicators for codebook.
                In this project the physical layer of 5G NR and more explicitly explores the transmission of 5G NR over the physical uplink shared
                channel (PUSCH) considering several parameters. For example, demodulated reference signal configuration (DM-RS), sub-carrier
                spacings (SCSs) are taken into account for analyzing the performance of PUSCH in terms of throughput versus Signal-to-Noise
                Ratio (SNR).</center></p>
